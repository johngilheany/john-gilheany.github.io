title: Detecting Prostate Cancer Using a Convolutional Neural Network with Transfer Learning
summary: Fine tuned a pretrained ResNet50 CNN model, achieving an accuracy greater than 89%. Employed tiling and stitching techniques to have the model output a probability shaded cancer mask overlayed on a whole-slide image. Deployed model on a streamlit app, where custom tissue samples can be uploaded and tested
